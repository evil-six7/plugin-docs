# Color Tokens

Color tokens make up a big part of Tokens Studio for Figma, as they're so tightly integrated with Figma's styles but give you options that Styles don't offer (yet).

You can use color tokens for various things:

- Updating color styles
- Creating color styles
- Applying a fill color
- Applying a stroke color

## Solid colors

There are multiple ways you can write color tokens:

- Hex: `#ff0000`
- RGB: `rgb(255, 0, 0)`
- RGBA: `rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)`
- HSLA: `hsla(120, 50%, 50%, 1)`

By default, a token references a Solid Paint (single colors).

## Modifiers (Pro)

We also support color modifiers which can help you create dynamic colors based on some parameters, such as lighten, darken, mix and alpha. You can [read more about modifiers here](/tokens/color-modifiers).

## Gradients

You can define gradient color tokens by specifying a css-like syntax: `linear-gradient(45deg, #ffffff 0%, #000000 100%)`.

If you need multiple color steps, just add more (minimum is 2). `linear-gradient(45deg, #ffffff 0%, #ff0000 50%, #000000 100%)`

### Token References
The great thing about token gradients is that you can create gradients that reference another token, something that is not possible in Figma itself. `linear-gradient(45deg, $colors.white 0%, $colors.black 100%)`

### Alpha values (opacity)
Opacity is supported as well, you can write your gradients like this: `linear-gradient(45deg, rgba($colors.primary, 0.5) 0%, rgba($colors.primary, 1) 100%)`

### Limitations
- Positioning your gradient on a layer, as you can do in Figma, is currently not possible, as we won't know where to position it, as we only store the degree, not any translation.


<Callout emoji="❓">
You might want to apply color or text tokens with the plugin, instead of using Figma's native style feature. This has a downside, which is that when the style is not local (but in a library) the plugin can't apply that style and will fall back to the hex value. For it to apply styles instead, we need to store the Figma Style IDs of each associated style. This is possible with the Themes feature!
