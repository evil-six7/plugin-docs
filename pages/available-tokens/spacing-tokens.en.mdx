# Spacing Tokens

Spacing tokens give you the ability to define values for Auto Layout that you can reuse. Once you apply a spacing token to a layer, it will be updated whenever you change that token. Therefore, any layer containing a reference to `{spacing.container}` will also be updated when you modify that specific token.
#### How to use

1. Add a new token in the `Spacing` type.
2. Select or create a layer with Auto-layout(does not work on any other layer type).
3. Once selected, you can apply a spacing token by either left-clicking (all values will have this token applied) or right-clicking and then specifying which part or side of the layer you want to target like: `Gap`, `All`, `Top`, `Right`, `Bottom`, `Left` . You can also select `horizontal-padding` and `vertical-padding` to apply a spacing token to all the four sides respectively.

### Multi-value spacing tokens

To save a lot of time, we introduced the multi-value spacing tokens. This allows you to specify spacing just for the horizontal or vertical padding. You are able to define one, two, three or four values, just like CSS.

**Single value (like today)**<br/>
This will apply to the gap property (like today)<br/>
```10px```

**Two values**<br/>
This will apply top-and-bottom | left-and-right<br/>
```8px 64px```

**Three values**<br/>
This will apply top | right-and-left | bottom<br/>
```16px 8px 32px```

**Four values**<br/>
This will apply top | right | bottom | left<br/>
```2px 4px 8px 16px```
