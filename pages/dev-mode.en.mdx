# Dev mode 

We have now added support to Figma's **Dev Mode** for the **Tokens Studio for Figma** plugin.

import Callout from 'nextra-theme-docs/callout'

### How to enable
When in Figma's dev mode, search for **Tokens Studio for Figma** in the `Plugins` tab, and click on save. 
In the inspect tab, you can then change it from `CSS` to `Tokens Studio for Figma` under the `Language` dropdown menu. 
Once selected, you can then proceed to select a frame which will then display the applied tokens in the inspect panel on the right. 

**NOTE:** You can only access dev mode for Tokens Studio by toggling on Figma's `Dev mode`. 

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
    We currently do not display the raw values of **any** applied tokens, just the names of the tokens that are applied.
</Callout>
